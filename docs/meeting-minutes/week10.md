### Decisions Made
- We created new propellers due to issues with the propellers we purchased:
    - The propellers we have do not fit well onto our motor bit
    - Issues might arise if we need to glue the propeller shaft to the motor bit, so we would need an extension of the motor shaft
- Our new propeller design addresses both of these issues and we have the ability to adjust the model as needed due to excess filament
