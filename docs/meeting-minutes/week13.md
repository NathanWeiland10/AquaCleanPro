# Week 13
## Thursday, April 11th, 2024
### Time
- 8:00am - 9:20am
### Attendees/Role
- Nathan
- Ethan T
- Ethan H
- Nermeen
- Thomas
### Decisions Made
- Ethan T sent an email to our Advisor (Buck) about presenting on Thursday April 25th at either 8:30am or 9:30am
- Ethan T and Nathan drilled hole in water-proof box to allow pH sensor wire to fit
- Nermeen ordered motor shaft adapters to attach our propellers
    - Issues could arise if we were to directly attach our propellers to the motor shaft since the adhesive could stick to the back of the motor
- Ethan T, Nathan, and Thomas applied more water-proof sealant to the edges of the craft
- Ethan H worked on PostgREST to fix our encrypted buffer table
- Clips were added to the front of the craft to hold our net in place

### Decisions Made
- Big work day:
    - Some tests for the battery were completed as well as tests for fitting together our components
    - Ethan H continued work on the postgREST side and posting to encryption buffer
    - Nathan, Nermeen, and Ethan T Found bits that we can glue the propellers / motor to and still turn
        - Nermeen will be taking home the motors / propellers to test other bits incase they work better
    - We tested the bot in a utility sink for leaks and waterproofness. It passed the buoyancy test but it failed the leak test.
    - Motor caps were sanded to fit on easier 
- Next steps:
    - Fix issues with integrating our code for our sensors together
    - Complete remaining tests and add results to our complete design document
    - Finish slides for presentation and assign slider numbers
