# Week 2
## Thursday, January 25th, 2024
### Time
- 8:30am - 9:00pm
### Attendees/Role
- Nathan
- Ethan T
- Ethan H
- Nermeen
- Thomas
### Decisions Made
- Using pre-made propellers instead of printing them
    - Adjust the width of the propeller ports from 40mm to 45mm
    - Nathan will send an email to Buck and Billy to include the pre-made propeller in our budget / list of materials
- Since our parts still have not arrived, we can use some of our own equipment for testing, such as testing with an ESP-32, or use online emulators
- Ensure that Grafana is connected with the backend for sending data
- **Action Items:**
    - Ethan H will work on the Grafana display
    - Ethan T will work on connectivity of the ESP-32
    - Nathan will work on the issues with GitHub pages and finish the documentation for the docs viewer
    - Nermeen will focus on the 3D printing / motor housing and setup Tinkercad accounts
    - Thomas will focus on using Tinkercad / Wowki for writing code for the ESP-32
### Questions or Concerns
- Concern: Check in to see the status of our parts - especially for 3D printing
- Issue with GitHub pages resetting our custom domain of "docs.aquacleanpro.org" - we may need to configure the settings in Squarespace
