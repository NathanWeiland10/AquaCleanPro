### Decisions Made
- Update the 3D model:
    - Removing a section of the back wall and replacing it with L-shaped channels for wiring (removing the blue square area). This will allow for extra room for netting and to reduce drag in the water.
    - Adding counterweight for motors by filling in the front portions of the ballasts of where our motors will be (the red circles).

- Possibility of adding cosmetics or decorations after printing as time allows.
- Meeting at Joshi 367 on Tuesdays, and meeting on Thursdays at Joshi 367 if needed
### Questions or Concerns
