### Attendees/Role
- Nathan
- Ethan T
- Ethan H
- Nermeen
- Thomas
### Decisions Made
- Propellors will be difficult to 3D print. Instead, we will order them from Amazon. The following link was chosen due to their shaft width (3mm) and diameter (32mm) to fit the existing enclosure design. Nermeen has emailed Billy to add it to our order. (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RHK1TFS/ref=sspa_dk_detail_9)
- The pH sensor we ordered was on backorder until March 8th. We've found the following alternative available on Amazon which will hopefully arrive before March 8th and emailed Lynn Rhea asking to replace the item. (https://www.amazon.com/Accuracy-Connect-Terminal-Electrode-Detection/dp/B08GYF269Y)
- **Action Items:**
    - Ethan H will figure out the decryption between PostgreSQL/PostgREST and Grafana. Executing the TinyAES decryption function inside PostgreSQL may be a solution.
    - Nathan will update the documentation on how to update the documentation.
    - Thomas will try to emulate a pH sensor with WOKWI.
    - Ethan T will start trying to print the enclosure.
### Questions or Concerns
- Buck let us know that we're allowed to meet only once a week and it doesn't have to be during our scheduled class time or in SSC. Do we want to start meeting one day a week? Do we want to meet in Russ? If we want to meet during a time outside of our scheduled class, Buck has to be available.
