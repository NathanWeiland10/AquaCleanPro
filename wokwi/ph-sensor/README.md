This is a ph sensor approximation being developed to be used in wokwi. 
This is being done because the ph sensor part we need has been delayed, and we want to get to work. 

The PH Sensor we are attempting to model: https://www.amazon.com/Accuracy-Connect-Terminal-Electrode-Detection/dp/B08GYF269Y/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2W2YCJIAVAMHU&keywords=Gravity%3A+Analog+pH+Sensor+%2F+Meter+Kit+for+Arduino&qid=1706326417&sprefix=gravity+analog+ph+sensor+%2F+meter+kit+for+arduino%2Caps%2C74&sr=8-1 

Should be able to drop this into wokwi with little issue.
